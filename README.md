# Lineman + Ember

A little example that pulls [lineman](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman) & [ember](https://emberjs.com) together.

To get started, clone this repo, and then:

```
$ npm install
$ npm install -g lineman
$ lineman run
```

And then visit the page at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
