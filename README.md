# Lineman + Ember

A little example that pulls [lineman](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman) & [ember](http://emberjs.com) together.

If you haven't already done so, first: install [node.js](http://nodejs.org); next, install lineman:

$ npm install -g lineman

To work from this example, just clone into it and run:

```
$ npm install
$ lineman run
```

And then visit the page at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to verify that it works.
